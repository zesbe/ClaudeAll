refactoring skill helps improve code quality and maintainability through systematic identification and elimination of code smells and implementation of design patterns.

For code review, check that:
1. Code has no obvious code smells (duplicate code, long methods, etc.)
2. Design patterns are appropriately applied
3. Code follows SOLID principles
4. Function and class names are descriptive
5. Comments explain "why" not "what"
6. Code is modular and loosely coupled
7. Test coverage is maintained
8. Technical debt is tracked and addressed
