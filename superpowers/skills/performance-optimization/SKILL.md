performance-optimization skill helps identify and resolve performance bottlenecks in applications through systematic profiling and optimization techniques.

For code review, check that:
1. Profiling has been done for critical paths
2. Performance benchmarks exist
3. Memory leaks are checked
4. Algorithm complexity is optimal (O(n log n) or better)
5. Database queries are optimized
6. Caching strategies are implemented where appropriate
