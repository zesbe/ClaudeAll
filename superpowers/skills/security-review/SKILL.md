security-review skill helps identify and mitigate security vulnerabilities in code through systematic security analysis using OWASP guidelines.

For code review, check that:
1. Input validation is implemented for all user inputs
2. Authentication and authorization are properly implemented
3. SQL injection prevention is in place
4. XSS protection is implemented
5. CSRF tokens are used for state-changing operations
6. Sensitive data is encrypted at rest and in transit
7. Security headers are properly configured
8. Dependency vulnerability scans have been run
